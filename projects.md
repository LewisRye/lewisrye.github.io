## <a href="https://github.com/lewisrye/inventory-system" target="_blank">C# Inventory System</a>
### Author

My first project, it is a simple inventory management system for a small business. Everything needed to keep track of new stock with aesthetic graphing. Currently developing an API for the backend of this program so that SQL queries are not performed directly inside the application.

### Author

A Java chat app, allowing for multiple client connections to a central server. This project uses Sockets and gave me an understanding of networking in Java. Can be hosted locally or on a remote server. Still in development.
