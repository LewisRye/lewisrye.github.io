## C# Inventory System
### Author

This was my first project, it is a simple inventory management system for a small business. Everything needed to keep track of new stock with aesthetic graphing. Still in development.

A Java P2P chat app, allowing for multiple client connections to a central server. This project uses Sockets and gave me an understanding of networking in Java. Can be hosted locally or on a remote server. Still in development.
